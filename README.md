<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Main page][product-screenshot]

This project aims to create a standalone application for macOS to label videos generated by nympy arrays with a size of 8 by 8. This application makes it very easy to label these videos and also facilitate the viewing of the videos. The labeling of videos will generate and save data on the video that can be used to analyze the physics effect appearing on the videos. This project has been produced by Rémi Picard.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This GUI can be used by running the code in a code editor or directly in your mac terminal if the code Python is in your working directory. 

Or you can also create a **standalone application** which will allow the GUI to be used on every macOS devices without needing to have Python installed on it.

### Prerequisites

The software needs the previous libraries to be installed in order to run properly. These librairies and their version are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install all of them by writting the following command in your terminal.

* Requirements
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* avgWaveData8by8</p>
You need to put the numpy arrays 8by8 containing the raw data you want to label in the **avgWaveData8by8** folder. The name of the arrays should be 
**{case}.npy**


### Running the code

1. Download the latest version of <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> (v3.10) 
2. Clone the repository in a chosen directory
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/remPicard/GUI_SpatialLabelling.git
   ```
3. Make sure the folders `GUI_images` and `numpyArrays8by8` are in the same directory as the code `GUI.py` before you execute it.

4. Execute the code `GUI.py` 
   ```py
   python3 GUI.py
   ```

5. Read the instructions to know how to use correctly the GUI. They are  included in one of the page of the GUI.


### Standalone application

You can also create a standalone macOS application of the GUI if you execute the code `setup.py` with the py2app Python setuptools command.  

1. Install py2app using this command in the terminal.
   ```py
   python3 pip install -U py2app
   ```
2. Make sure the file **GUI.py** and the folders **GUI_images** and **numpyArrays8by8** are in the same directory as the code `setup.py` before you execute it.

3. Clean up your build directories in your working directory
   ```py
   rm -rf build dist
   ```

4. Build the app in your working directory
   ```py
   python3 setup.py py2app
   ```

5. Find the app in the dist folder which has been created in your current directory and move this application to your Applications directory.

6. Use the app on your device or share it to other mac users. Each time a feature will be added in the code, the application will need to be rebuild to have this new feature.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage of the GUI

To use correclty this application, please read the instructions contained in the pages of the GUI. These instructions will teach you how to label the videos and to use effectively the GUI with the keyboard shortcuts included. </p>
The code save automatically your labelling work in the csv file you are currently working in. So no need to save your work at the end and do not worry if something wrong like a crash or a bug happen on your computer.
